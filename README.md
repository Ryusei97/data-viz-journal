# ðŸ“Š Data Viz Journal

Welcome to **Data Viz Journal** â€” a personal playground for exploring data through visuals. This repo contains self-contained mini projects, each focused on a unique dataset or concept, aiming to inform, inspire, or just look cool.

## ðŸ§  What is this?

This repository is a growing collection of visualizations created with Python libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `altair`, and others. Each notebook tells a small story or presents a fun slice of information â€” sometimes insightful, sometimes experimental, always visual.
